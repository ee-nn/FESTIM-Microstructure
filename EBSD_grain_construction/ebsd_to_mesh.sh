# =============================================================================
# A single EBSD map -> triangular mesh conforming to the raster's own grain
# boundaries, for the FESTIM codim-1 grain-boundary transport script.
#
# `neper -M map.tesr` meshes the raster directly, which is supported in 2D only.
# The msh4 carries the reconstructed topology as physical groups ver#, edge#,
# face#, and face k is raster cell k, so:
#
#   grain boundary  : 1D element set "edge#", touching two "face#" sets
#   specimen surface: 1D element set touching one face
#   theta           : disorientation of the two grains' orientations
#                     (${STEM}-grainori.txt), computed in the Python driver
#   triple junction : mesh vertex where 3+ distinct edge ids meet
#
# Outputs: ${STEM}.msh4 (Gmsh v4, linear triangles, all dimensions),
# ${STEM}.sttesr (raster geometry) and ${STEM}-grainori.txt (one orientation
# per grain).
#
# This script runs Neper and Gmsh only. The Python side of the pipeline is a
# set of library modules with no command line, so the two diagnostics that need
# the mesh are written by ebsd_gb_diffusion.mesh_diagnostics(), which runs
# straight after this returns: check-mesh.png (the reconstructed boundary edges
# over the raster cells) and check-area.png / ${STEM}-areachange.csv, the
# per-grain area change between raster and mesh. That table is this stage's
# quality number, as the RMS disorientation out of ctf_to_tesr.convert() is
# stage 1's.
#
# The renders of the raster itself -- <stem>-ori.png and <stem>-grains.png --
# depend on the .tesr and nothing here, so ctf_to_tesr.convert(diagnostics=True)
# makes them at conversion time. Nothing in this script calls neper -V.
#
# All parameters arrive as environment variables so the Python driver stays the
# single source of truth. Run standalone by exporting them yourself.
