"""Short-circuit diffusion through the GB network of a polycrystal
measured by EBSD, in 2D.

Whole network is a single codim-1 subdomain carrying 1 species, so
the submesh built from all the GB facets is topologically connected
and hydrogen crosses from one boundary to another with no junction
condition.

Nothing about a disorientation requires three dimensions, it is computed
from the two grain orientations either way.

The mesh is Neper's direct meshing of the raster (`neper -M map.tesr`, 2D
only), so the grain boundaries are the measured ones. Neper writes
no .tess for that route (`-format tess` segfaults in 5.0.0), so the
tessellation-level bookkeeping -- which grains an edge separates, whether it
lies on the specimen surface, theta, length, junctions -- is rebuilt here from
the mesh: the msh4 carries the reconstructed boundary topology as 1D element
sets `edge#` and the grains as 2D element sets `face#`, with face k being
raster cell k, and theta follows from the two grain orientations under cubic
symmetry using the same disorientation function that segmented the map.

The one thing 2D genuinely costs is connectivity, which is what this script
measures. See the note at the end of ebsd_to_mesh.sh: percolation thresholds
for GB networks are far lower in 2D than in 3D, so a THETA_MIN that
fragments this network may leave the corresponding 3D one connected. Treat the
enhancement factor as a lower bound unless the microstructure is columnar, in
which case 2D is exact.

    With route A there is no tessellation file to take statistics from, but the

    one boundary edge of the raster (after interface smoothing) and every 2D
    element set ``face#`` is raster cell k, so the grains on either side of an
    edge are the tags of the cells its facets belong to. From that:

    - ``domtype``: -1 for an edge between two grains, 1 for an edge with a
      single grain, i.e. on the specimen surface (in 2D the domain boundary is
      made of edges, so this is the whole story);
    - ``theta``: cubic disorientation between the two grains' mean
      orientations, read from ``-grainori.txt``. It is invariant under a
      global inversion of all orientations (the misorientations are inverted
      and conjugated, neither of which changes an angle under two-sided cubic
      symmetry), so the active/passive question does not enter here;
    - ``length``, ``ymin``, ``ymax``: summed / extremised over the edge's
      facets, in metres because the mesh was scaled on reading;
    - triple junctions: vertices where 3+ distinct edge ids meet and that do
      not lie on the bounding box. On a raster four grains can meet at a pixel
      corner, and those are counted too.

    The adjacency is gathered across ranks because a facet on a partition
    boundary sees only one of its two cells locally; lengths and extrema are
    reduced. The junction count is exact in serial and a lower bound in parallel
