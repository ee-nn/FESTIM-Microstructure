"""Periodic Voronoi microstructures and the meshes that conform to them.

The grain boundaries are *lines*, not thin bands: nothing here resolves the
physical boundary width ``delta``. That width only ever appears as a
coefficient, which is what lets a 1 nm boundary sit inside a 20 um cell. What
the mesh must do is put facets exactly on the ridges, so that a codim-1 subdomain
can be built from them.

Grains can be elongated (``aspect``): the seeds are Voronoi-tessellated in a
coordinate stretched along x, so the grains come out with an aspect ratio while
staying a proper periodic tessellation. An equiaxed tessellation homogenises to a
nearly isotropic tensor, so the elongation is what makes the anisotropy
identification worth doing.
