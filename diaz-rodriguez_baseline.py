"""Díaz-Rodríguez et al. (2022) OKMC permeation setup, as a FESTIM continuum model.

Their box: a single columnar grain, L x L lateral, d deep, with the four
*lateral* faces defined as grain boundary. Permeation runs along the column
axis (z), from a charged surface at z=0 to a sink at z=d. L = 50, 100, 150 nm;
d = 50, 100, 200 nm. They could not reach the experimental d = 2 um because
the OKMC times were prohibitive (their Sect. 3.3). That is the gap this script
fills: the continuum model has no such cost, so we run the experimental
thickness over many columns.

WHAT A REGULAR NX x NY TILING DOES AND DOES NOT TEST
---------------------------------------------------
With identical columns and no-flux lateral boundaries, every column sees the
same environment, so 100 x 100 columns give the same per-column answer as one
column. The regular tiling is therefore a *verification* run: if the flux
fraction moves when NX changes, something is wrong with the coupling or the
facet location. Set DISORDER=1 to make the array non-trivial -- it draws a
per-boundary GB migration energy from the 0.191-0.547 eV range Wei et al.
(2026, doi:10.1016/j.ijhydene.2025.152835) report across eight tungsten GBs,
which spans a factor of ~4e3 in D_gb at 500 K. That is the regime no single-
column OKMC box can reach and is the actual reason to run 10,000 grains.

PARAMETERS AND WHERE THEY COME FROM
-----------------------------------
From the paper (Sect. 2.4, 3.2, Figs. 3, 7, 8):
  E_m,bulk = 0.20 eV, E_m,GB = 0.12 eV, E_bind = 1.05 eV  (DFT, their Fig. 3)
  max GB occupation 0.25 - 6.25 H/nm^2, swept; 6.25 matched experiment
  charged surface held at 5.6 H/nm^3 over a 0.4 nm near-surface region
  temperatures 520-705 K

NOT in the paper, assumed here and flagged:
  * Arrhenius prefactors. The paper says the parametrisation is that of its
    ref. [9] and does not restate it. D0_BULK = 1.9e-7 m^2/s is the standard
    tungsten value whose barrier (0.20 eV) is exactly their E_m,bulk, so it is
    the consistent choice. D0_GB is taken as 1.5 x D0_BULK, the ratio of the
    2D to the 3D random-walk prefactor (1/4 vs 1/6) at equal jump distance and
    attempt frequency -- they state explicitly that GB migration is 2D and
    bulk migration 3D.
  * DELTA, the GB slab width. Their OKMC GB is a discrete atomic plane with an
    areal site density, so no width is defined. It matters here because the GB
    current is DELTA * D_gb * grad(c_gb): f_GB is close to linear in DELTA.
    0.5 nm is the order of their 0.4 nm near-surface region. Treat any f_GB
    from this script as carrying that proportionality.
  * The prefactor in s. Detailed balance gives s = (lam_b nu_f)/(lam_gb nu_r)
    exp(E_bind/kT); the ratio is O(1) and is set to 1.

  39 H/nm^2 is NOT the trap density. That is the 0 K DFT filling limit of
  their Fig. 6, which they say explicitly is not reached at temperature and is
  not what the OKMC used. The OKMC used 0.25-6.25 H/nm^2.

THE COUPLING LAW
----------------
One-way fluxes, not a symmetric driving force. Per unit GB area,

    J = K c_b (1 - c_gb/N_gb)  -  (K/s) c_gb

The forward coefficient K is kinetic and follows from the bulk->GB barrier
alone; s is thermodynamic and follows from E_bind alone; the reverse
coefficient K/s is fixed by detailed balance and is never specified
independently. N_gb is the capacity and is the only trap-like part.
Equilibrium gives the McLean isotherm, which is the isotherm Zhou et al. use.

Saturation is expected to dominate here. At 705 K, s = exp(1.05/kT) ~ 3e7 and
N_gb/s ~ 4e20 m^-3, against a surface concentration of 5.6e27 m^-3. The
boundaries are therefore full near the inlet and can only develop the gradient
that carries current deeper in. A saturated boundary carries no net flux, so
the max-occupancy sweep is not a detail -- it is the controlling physics, and
it is why the paper's own permeability rises with the occupancy limit.
